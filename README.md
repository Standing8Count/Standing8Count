- 👋 Hi, I’m @Standing8Count
- 👀 I’m interested in developing on the Bitcoin lightning network. I have very basic coding experience (python - beginner level) and a total novice to coding but I have some ideas and I'm looking to develop them.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for the best programming language to learn for coding on the lightning network. I'm aware that Go, Eclair and C-lightning are available, but have no idea about the pros and cons for each of those, nor do I know which to start off with.
- 💞️ I’m looking for anyone with the patience to hand hold and guide a noob! And collaborate!
- 📫 How to reach me: standing.8.count.is.the.1@gmail.com
